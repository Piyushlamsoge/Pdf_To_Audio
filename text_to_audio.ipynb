Do you often\\nfeel restless and unable to focus on the task at hand? Do you\\nhave trouble getting excited about the important goals that\\ncould improve your life?\\nIf so, you might need a dopamine detox.\\nIn today’s world where distractions are everywhere, our\\nability to focus has become a scarce commodity. We’re\\nconstantly being stimulated, feeling restless, often without\\nknowing why. When the time comes to focus on the key tasks\\nthat would enable us to make progress toward our goals, we\\ncan often ﬁnd a plethora of other things to do. Instead of\\nworking toward our goals, we might pop out for a walk, grab\\na co\\x00ee, check our emails or reorganize our ﬁles instead.\\nEverything seems like a great idea—everything except the\\nvery thing we s h o u ld be doing.\\nAs we repeat this same pattern every day, we can let our\\nbiggest goals and loftier dreams slip between our ﬁngers. We\\nunderperform and accomplish far less than we’re capable of.\\nAnd deep down we know it, which erodes our self-esteem\\nand creates frustration, disappointment, apathy, jealousy, or\\neven anger.But it doesn’t have to be this way.\\nWhen you learn to remove distractions and move away from\\nthis constant state of stimulation and restlessness, you can\\naccomplish most of your challenging tasks. By doing so\\nconsistently, you will become more productive—and much\\nhappier as a result.\\nAre you ready to let go of unnecessary stimulations and\\nreclaim your focus so that you can achieve your goals?\\nMore speciﬁcally, in the 48h Dopamine Detox, you’ll learn\\nhow to:\\nRemove overstimulation and feel focused and\\npeaceful during work,\\nFeel naturally motivated to work on the key tasks that\\nwill enable you to reach your biggest goals (instead of\\nprocrastinating),\\nEliminate unproductive activities and distractions,\\nand skyrocket your ability to focus, and much more.\\nIf any of the above lessons interest you, read on.INTRODUCTION\\nTell me if this is you:\\nYou know that if you could tackle just one speciﬁc task, it\\nwould have a massive impact on your overall levels of\\nproductivity. Perhaps it would improve your chances of\\nearning a promotion. Or perhaps it would enhance your\\nmental or physical well-being.\\nBut you never seem to start.\\nInstead of working on your goal ﬁrst thing in the morning,\\nyou end up checking your emails, looking at your stock\\nportfolio, or scrolling your Facebook newsfeed instead.\\nSoon enough, that important task will appear less and less\\nappealing. You tell yourself you’ll just have one more co\\x00ee.\\nOr you’ll click on just one more YouTube video. But the more\\nyou delay your task, the harder it becomes to get started. It’s\\nas though an invisible mental barrier had appeared between\\nyou and your task, and this barrier seems impossible to\\novercome.\\nHave you ever felt this way?If so, you’ll greatly beneﬁt from this book. In it, we’ll\\nintroduce a simple method you can use to avoid\\noverstimulation and make it easier to tackle your key tasks.\\nSo, are you up for the challenge?\\nIn Part I. Dopamine and the Role it Plays, we’ll explain what\\ndopamine actually is and how it works. After reading this\\nsection, you’ll understand why you can’t stop checking your\\nphone, struggle to stay away from social media, or binge-\\nwatch videos.\\nIn Part II. The Problem, we’ll see why dopamine can be an\\nissue these days. In this part, you’ll discover how your\\ndopamine transmitters have been hijacked and why this can\\nbe a major challenge.\\nIn Part III. The Beneﬁts of a Detox, we’ll review all the\\nreasons a dopamine detox can be useful. We’ll introduce a\\nnumber of di\\x00erent types of dopamine detoxes and we will\\ndiscuss several misconceptions regarding dopamine.\\nIn Part IV. A Three-Step Method for a Successful Detox,\\nwe’ll explain in detail how you can implement an e\\x00ective\\ndopamine detox in three simple steps.\\nIn Part V. Doing the Work (and Overcoming\\nProcrastination), we’ll focus on getting you back to work. In\\nthis segment, you’ll learn how to plan your day e\\x00ectively\\nand remove distractions to help you remain focused.\\nFinally, in Part VI. Avoiding “Dopamine Relapse”, we’ll\\nwork through some simple tools and techniques to help you\\navoid overstimulation and stay focused on your key tasks\\nover the long term.\\nLet’s get started, shall we?Your Fr ee Step-By-Step W orkbook\\nTo help reclaim your focus I’ve created a workbook as a\\ncompanion guide to this book.

You\\ncan check out the second book, Immediate Action at the URL\\nbelow:\\nmybook.to/immediate_action\\nPART I\\nDOPAMINE AND THE ROLE IT PLAYS\\nYou’ve probably heard about dopamine before and have at\\nleast a vague idea of what it is. In this section, we’ll brieﬂy\\ndeﬁne dopamine and describe the role it plays.\\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter which makes us anticipate\\nrewards such as having sexual relationships or eating\\nnourishing food. Dopamine gives us the desire to take action\\nto earn the exciting reward that’s waiting for us. It is the\\nforce that makes us act. As such, it is a very useful\\nneurotransmitter that has helped us survive and reproduce—\\nand probably one of the main reasons you and I exist today.\\nContrary to what many people believe, dopamine is n o t a\\npleasure chemical. Simply because an event triggers the\\nrelease of dopamine doesn’t mean it is something we like or\\nget pleasure from. In fact, when you pay close attention,\\nyou’ll notice that as soon as you obtain the expected reward,\\nyou’ll often feel empty and unfulﬁlled.\\nThe truth is that no amount of stimulation will ever bring\\nyou the sense of fulﬁllment you’re seeking. Yet, many of usare constantly overstimulated, looking for the next source\\nthat could trigger a release of dopamine. It seems as though\\nwe always want more and are never satisﬁed. And the more\\nwe seek stimulation, the worse it becomes.\\nNow, look at your own life. What are you addicted to? What\\ndo you crave? What are your main sources of stimulation? Do\\nthese things really make you happy?\\nAs you consider these questions, you’ll probably notice that\\nyou’re addicted to highly stimulating activities (such as\\nwatching video games, immersing yourself in social media\\nor reading emails). When you undertake these activities, you\\nstart losing self-control—you want more and more\\nstimulation. And even though they may not give you any real\\npleasure or lasting fulﬁllment, you keep doing them. After\\nall, you need the next hit of dopamine, don’t you?\\nUnder such a state of stimulation, any task that requires\\nconcentration becomes much harder to perform. As a result,\\nyou will procrastinate. You delay writing that book you’ve\\nalways planned. You put o\\x00 starting that new venture, or\\nyou’ll postpone that key project you’re in charge of.\\nTo sum up, from an evolutionary perspective, dopamine’s\\nrole is to encourage you to act to earn the anticipated reward\\nneeded for your survival or reproduction. This is dopamine’s\\nprimary role. Unfortunately, in today’s world, the process\\nhas been hijacked, which leads to many unintended\\nconsequences, as we’ll discuss in the next section.Action step\\nUsing your action guide, answer the following questions:\\nWhat are you addicted to?\\nWhat are your main sources of stimulation?\\nDo they really make you happy?PART II\\nTHE PROBLEM\\nPreviously, we’ve seen how dopamine plays an important\\nrole from an evolutionary standpoint. In this section, we’ll\\nsee why this neurotransmitter has been hijacked and what\\nyou can do to guard yourself against the dopamine “traps”\\nwe face in today’s society.\\nThe neurotransmitter of more\\nYou can think of dopamine as the “molecule of more”. This\\nis because the more our environment or actions trigger the\\nrelease of dopamine, the more we’ll want our next “shot” of\\ndopamine. In fact, this self-reinforcing mechanism is also\\nhow many addictions work.\\nBy continuously triggering the release of dopamine through\\ndi\\x00erent means—such as drug or alcohol consumption—\\naddicts actually strengthen their tolerance to such\\nstimulation. As a result, they need stronger and stronger\\nstimulus to experience the same sensation of pleasure.However, addictions are not just limited to drug or alcohol\\nconsumption. In truth, many activities can become\\nsomewhat addictive, for example:\\nGambling\\nSex\\nShopping\\nThoughts/rumination\\nVideo games\\nExercise (to extreme)\\nWork\\nWhat about you? Are you currently addicted to anything? If\\nyou can’t spend a day without engaging in a certain activity,\\nit means you’re probably a little addicted to it. Fortunately,\\nas we’ll see later, there are ways to limit the amount of\\nstimulation we’re exposed to each day. And, as we reduce our\\nexposure to stimulating activities, we will naturally increase\\nour focus and boost our productivity levels.\\nNow, let’s see how your dopamine neurotransmitter is being\\nhijacked in today’s world. More importantly, let’s see the\\nspeciﬁc things you can do to regain control.\\nAction step\\nUsing your action guide, write down a past situation when\\nyou couldn’t stop doing something. Are there any activities\\nyou can’t stay away from for one whole day? Write it down as\\nwell.\\nYour dopamine neurotransmitters are being hijackedYour focus is a scarce asset, which is why marketers spend\\nbillions of dollars to attract your attention. Many apps are\\ndesigned to hook you. Social media companies like YouTube,\\nFacebook, and Instagram know that the more time you\\nspend on their platforms, the more money they make\\nthrough advertising. Perhaps one of their greatest recent\\ndiscoveries is the use of notiﬁcations. How many times have\\nyou opened an app just because a red notiﬁcation pops up on\\nyour screen? And how much time did you waste\\nsubsequently? I wouldn’t be surprised if it ran into hundreds\\nof hours each year.\\nAnd, thanks to ever more sophisticated algorithms,\\ncompanies have become better at hooking us. Amazon’s\\nbook recommendation system is more accurate and\\nwidespread than any system a physical bookstore could\\ncreate. Likewise, YouTube suggestions are heavily\\ncustomized. And Facebook’s customer research algorithm is\\nquite amazing too. As a demonstration, try the following\\nexperiment:\\nVisit your newsfeed, watch a couple of suggested videos on a\\nsimilar topic and see what happens. The other day I watched\\na basketball video and immediately received a\\nrecommendation to view another one, so I watched it. And\\nthen, I watched another one, and so on.\\nNow, the development of sophisticated algorithms has its\\npros and cons. On the plus side, it becomes easier to discover\\ncontent you actually want to watch. On the negative side, it\\nmakes it easier to become stuck in a never-ending loop,\\nwatching one video after the other. In a sense, instead of\\nusing the internet to ﬁnd information or communicate with\\nloved ones, the internet has become the one using you. Itdoes so by hijacking your focus and making you\\nunproductive and, as a result, restless.\\nSocial media notiﬁcations are a great example of how your\\nbrain is being hijacked. Whenever you see a notiﬁcation, you\\nanticipate the reward you’ll receive when clicking on it,\\nwhich triggers the release of dopamine in your brain.\\nHowever, this doesn’t make you happy or fulﬁll you—at\\nleast not for long. Remember, dopamine is not a pleasure\\nchemical; it is a neurotransmitter that is activated when you\\nanticipate a potential pleasure. And that pleasure is usually\\ntemporary. Below are some other ways your dopamine\\nneurotransmitters are being hijacked:\\nWhenever you check your email, you’re expecting a\\nreward, which could be a message from a friend or\\nsome exciting news.\\nWhenever you check stats, such as investment\\nportfolio, or website tra\\x00c stats, you expect a reward\\nfrom seeing encouraging numbers. And the\\nunpredictability makes it more exciting.\\nWhenever you visit YouTube, you expect to watch\\ninteresting or exciting videos.\\nWhenever you visit social media sites, such as\\nFacebook, Twitter or Instagram, you’re anticipating\\nrewards such as likes or comments on your posts,\\nmessages from friends or interesting content.\\nWhen you engage in any of the above activities, you risk\\nbecoming not only overstimulated but also distracted and, as\\na result, you will lose your ability to focus. Whoever has\\nsucceeded in staying away from the internet or social media\\nfor a few days, understands what a waste of time and focus\\nsuch activities can be.,What about you? How do you allow your dopamine\\nneurotransmitters to be hijacked?\\nFood craving\\nHunting for food used to be one of our biggest drivers for\\naction. Hunger, alongside the anticipation of a great reward\\n—food—leads us to act. And the food that gives us the most\\npleasure was highly nourishing, tasty, and often contained\\nsugar.\\nAccording to Professor Susanne Klaus, a biologist at the\\nGerman Institute of Human Nutrition in Potsdam, our\\ncraving for sweet foods is innate. Sugar triggers the release\\nof dopamine and makes us feel good. She wrote,\\n“Experiments have shown that the combination of sugar and fat\\nis especially e\\x00ective in stimulating the brain’s reward system.”\\nTherefore, it’s hardly surprising that we like to get our daily\\ndose of sugar and fat, is it?\\nHowever, these days, most of us live in a di\\x00erent\\nenvironment. Although we still need to feed ourselves, the\\nfeeling of anticipation that drove our ancestors to search for\\nfood has become irrelevant. We can simply visit our local\\nsupermarket and buy what we want. There is no need to\\nexert much e\\x00ort. And, for most of us, food is plentiful. Yet,\\nour biology has remained the same. We still experience that\\nfeeling of anticipation when being presented with rich food.\\nThis is where the food industry comes in. In this industry,\\nmarketers spend millions to encourage us to buy their\\nproducts. They discovered that, by adding sugar (among\\nother things), they can not only make the food more\\npalatable, but they make us crave more. For this reason, if\\nyou look at the list of ingredients contained in any processed\\nfood, you’ll ﬁnd sugar in most of them.However, I should mention that, while there is a debate on\\nthe actual addictive power of sugar, it is unlikely to be as\\naddictive as cocaine, as you might have read in some online\\narticles.\\nRobert Lustig, professor of pediatrics at the University of\\nCalifornia San Francisco, asserts that sugar is addictive but\\non the same level as nicotine, not drugs like heroin.\\nAs Dr. Ziauddeen, a psychiatrist at the University of\\nCambridge, noted, “The brain’s reward system and the circuits\\nthat control eating behavior are the same ones that respond to\\ndrugs of abuse,” but, unlike sugar, “drugs of abuse seem to\\nhijack those systems and turn o\\x00 their normal controls.”\\nFurthermore, Tom Sanders, emeritus professor of nutrition\\nand dietetics at King’s College London, wrote, it is “absurd to\\nsuggest that sugar is addictive like hard drugs.” He also said,\\n“While it is true that a liking for sweet things can be habit-\\nforming, it is not addictive like opiates or cocaine. Individuals do\\nnot get withdrawal symptoms when they cut sugar intake.”\\nTo conclude, humans seem to have a natural craving for\\nsugar and fat. While we may not be addicted to them per se,\\nit might be a good idea to reduce our intake and lower our\\ndependence on them, especially on sugar.\\nDopamine and constant stimulation can impair your ability\\nto think long term\\nStudies have shown that one of the best predictors of success\\nis the ability to think long term. People who repeatedly focus\\non where they want to be in the future, make better\\ndecisions in the present. They tend to eat healthier food, be\\nmore productive at work and save and invest more money\\nthan others.After extensive research into success, Dr. Edward Banﬁeld of\\nHarvard University concluded that long-time perspective,\\n“was the most important determinant of ﬁnancial and personal\\nsuccess in life.” He deﬁned “long-time” as the “ability to think\\nseveral years into the future while making decisions in the\\npresent.”\\nUnfortunately, these days, focusing on our long-term goals\\nisn’t an easy feat. Many external forces lead us to become\\ncaught up in short-term thinking and encourage us to fall\\nfor immediate gratiﬁcation.\\nWhile we often know what we should be doing, we fail to do\\nit. For example:\\nWe know we should eat healthily but binge-eat on\\nsweets or sugary beverages more than we should.\\nWe understand we should study, but we procrastinate\\nby watching yet another series on Netﬂix.\\nWe can see the beneﬁts of exercise, but we’d rather be\\nsitting and chatting with friends on social media.\\nI believe that social media, and the internet as a whole, have\\nnegatively impacted our ability to both think long-term and\\nto focus deeply on the task in front of us. It is no surprise,\\ntherefore, that Apple CEO, Steve Jobs, prohibited his children\\nfrom using phones or tablets—even though his business was\\nto sell millions of them to his customers!\\nThe billionaire investor and former senior executive at\\nFacebook, Chamath Palihapitiya, argues that we must rewire\\nour brain to focus on the long term, which starts by\\nremoving social media apps from our phones. In his words,\\nsuch apps, “wire your brain for super-fast feedback.”By receiving constant feedback, whether through likes,\\ncomments, or immediate replies to our messages, we\\ncondition ourselves to expect fast results with everything we\\ndo. And this feeling is certainly reinforced through ads for\\nschemes to help us “get rich quick”, and through cognitive\\nbiases (i.e., we only hear about the richest and most\\nsuccessful YouTubers, not about the ones who fail).\\nAs we demand more and more stimulation, our focus is\\nincreasingly geared toward the short term and our vision of\\nreality becomes distorted. This leads us to adopt inaccurate\\nmental models such as:\\nSuccess should come quickly and easily, or\\nI don’t need to work hard to lose weight or make\\nmoney.\\nUltimately, this erroneous concept distorts our vision of\\nreality and our perception of time. We can feel jealous of\\npeople who seem to have achieved overnight success. We can\\neven resent popular YouTubers. Even worse, we feel\\ninadequate. It can lead us to think we are just not good\\nenough, smart enough, or disciplined enough. Therefore, we\\nfeel the need to compensate by hustling harder. We have to\\nhurry before we miss the opportunity. We have to ﬁnd the\\nsecret that will help us become successful. And, in this\\nfrenetic race, we forget one of the most important values of\\nall: patience.\\nNo, watching motivational videos all day long won’t help you\\nreach your goals. But, performing daily consistent actions,\\nsustained over a long period of time will. Staying calm and\\nfocusing on the one task in front of you every day will.The point is, to achieve long-term goals in your personal or\\nprofessional life, you must regain control of your attention\\nand rewire your brain to focus on the long term. To do so,\\nyou should start by staying away from highly stimulating\\nactivities.\\nHere is a perfect illustration of long-term thinking:\\nAmazon, the world’s third-largest company, was created in\\n1994 but had to wait until 2003 to have its ﬁrst proﬁtable\\nyear. That year, it generated a net proﬁt of $35 million after\\nreporting a net loss of $149 million the previous year.\\nNow, its founder, Je\\x00 Bezos, could probably have made\\nproﬁts earlier, but, instead, he decided to reinvest in his\\nbusiness to create strong foundations that, he hoped, would\\nenable Amazon to survive for decades. I encourage you to do\\nthe same in your personal and professional life. Build the\\nfoundations for success one brick at a time. Build them\\nstrong so that they won’t collapse at the ﬁrst obstacle or\\nsetback.\\nRemember, long-term thinking is the “secret” to achieving\\nyour goals. But it won’t happen today or tomorrow. You must\\ndevelop the art of patience and consistency. To do so,\\neliminate the distractions that make you feel restless.\\nRemove the external stimulations that prevent you from\\nfocusing on the long-term picture. Then, you will stand a\\nmuch better chance of ending up where you want to be in the\\ncoming years.\\nThe bottom line is this:\\nIn many aspects, today’s society is designed to hijack your\\ndopamine neurotransmitters. And, unfortunately, this is not\\ndesigned in your best interest, it is designed to empty your\\nwallet as e\\x00ectively and thoroughly as possible. However,and more importantly, it dramatically erodes your ability to\\nfocus, making you feel restless and often bad about yourself.\\nOverstimulated, you ﬁnd yourself unable to do the di\\x00cult\\nthings that would have the greatest positive impact on your\\nlife and on the lives of people around you.\\nAction step\\nUsing your action guide, complete the prompt below by\\nbeing as speciﬁc as possible:\\nMy brain is being hijacked when…\\nYou’re overstimulated\\nWhile there are many reasons to procrastinate, the most\\nimportant one—and the one overlooked most often—is\\noverstimulation.\\nWhen you are calm and focused, doing your main work can\\nbe surprisingly easy. You might even be excited, looking\\nforward to making progress toward your biggest goals each\\nday. However, the problem is that you’re often anything but\\ncalm and focused. Instead, you’re rushing through your day,\\njumping from one task to the next. You tend to run in circles\\nlike a hamster in a wheel, yet you never seem to complete\\nyour work. You let interruptions kill your focus and you\\nwaste hours checking your emails, visiting social media sites\\nor watching one “educational” video after another.\\nIt often starts ﬁrst thing in the morning when you grab your\\nphone. Then, it continues when you check your emails. But it\\ndoesn’t stop there. You then decide to visit social media sites\\nfor “a few minutes”. By that time, emails, notiﬁcations, andlikes will have already triggered the release of dopamine into\\nyour system. In short, you’ve become overstimulated.\\nNow that you’ve received your dose of stimulation, you can\\nwork, right? But what happens when you sit at your desk to\\nwork on an important project? Does it come easy, or do you\\nfeel like doing everything else but working? Perhaps you tell\\nyourself you can work on that particular task later. Perhaps\\nyou suddenly fancy another cup of co\\x00ee or perhaps you just\\nremembered the email you need to answer.\\nYour work can wait—or so you think.\\nAs a result, you’re back into your hamster wheel, receiving\\nmore and more stimulation. This can last for hours or even\\ndays.\\nDo you recognize yourself in the above scenario?\\nThe problem with overstimulation\\nWhen you’re engaging in highly stimulating activities, your\\nbrain will keep demanding more and more stimulation. As\\nyour level of stimulation rises, regular tasks will appear\\nincreasingly dull and unappealing. You’ll ask yourself, why\\nwork on my book, write a report or create a marketing plan\\nwhen I could be doing something far more exciting?\\nThe gap between your current high level of stimulation and\\nthe lower level of stimulation needed to tackle di\\x00cult tasks\\nleads you to procrastinate. Picture it this way:\\nYou’re on a di\\x00erent stimulation wavelength, and this\\nwavelength has no overlap with the wavelength you must be\\nin to tackle your major tasks.\\nFor instance, as a writer, my most important task is to write\\n—obviously. However, as soon as I start checking socialmedia, signing into YouTube or looking at my sales ﬁgures, I\\nﬁnd myself pulled into a whirlpool of distractions from\\nwhich I can’t seem to escape. As my level of stimulation\\nincreases, writing becomes one of the most unappealing and\\nchallenging tasks imaginable.\\nNow, the key question is, what can we do about it? How can\\nwe lower our level of stimulation to make our major tasks\\nappear more appealing and even exciting?\\nWe’re going to discuss this in the next section.\\nAction step\\nUsing your action guide, write down a speciﬁc distraction\\npattern you often fall into that leads you to be in a state of\\noverstimulation. For instance, it could be checking Facebook,\\nthen watching videos in your newsfeed before checking your\\nemails and reading the news.\\nThe stimulation traps\\nAs soon as you enter a state of overstimulation, your mind\\nwill play tricks on you to convince you there is no need to\\nleave that “trance”. Instead, your mind encourages you to\\nembrace it and seek even more stimulation. After all, we\\nhave to enjoy life, right?\\nIn this section, let’s go over four tricks your mind plays on\\nyou to keep you overstimulated.\\nTrick #1—returning to work is easy\\nThe ﬁrst trick your mind will play on you is to pretend that\\nreturning to work will be easy. It will try to convince you thatyou can start work whenever you choose, that you’re in\\ncontrol of your actions. But this couldn’t be further from the\\ntruth. In most cases, you won’t be able to get back to work\\nfor hours. You might even ﬁnd yourself postponing your key\\ntasks until the next day.\\nThe bottom line is, once you’re overstimulated, you’ll ﬁnd it\\ndi\\x00cult to go back to work. I can’t count how many times I\\ntold myself I would start writing later.\\nIt never happens.\\nTherefore, if you catch yourself thinking you’re in control of\\nyour actions and can return to work whenever you want,\\nwatch out!\\nTrick #2—you can do it later\\nAnother trick your mind will use is to tell you that you can do\\nyour task later. It will convince you there is plenty of time in\\nthe afternoon or that you can always do it tomorrow, next\\nweek or next month. However, if you don’t ﬁght back,\\nputting things o\\x00 will become a habit. And ﬁve years from\\nnow, you’ll be angry at yourself for having accomplished so\\nfew goals.\\nTrick #3—excitement is not the same thing as fulﬁllment\\nWhen you’re engrossed in stimulating activities, your mind\\nwill sell you on how much fun and enjoyment you are having.\\nYou should do more of it. Don’t worry about anything else\\nfor now. Just enjoy yourself. Or so your mind says.\\nBut whatever your mind says, excitement doesn’t equal\\nfulﬁllment. Once your level of stimulation reverts back to\\nnormal, ask yourself the following questions:How much did I actually beneﬁt from watching YouTube\\nvideos, scrolling through my Facebook newsfeed, or\\nchecking my emails repeatedly? In hindsight, was the time\\nspent in a meaningful way? Did it enhance the quality of\\nyour life?\\nRemember, excitement isn’t fulﬁllment. Excitement can be\\nfun, but make sure you work on developing an inner sense of\\npeace and a heightened state of focus. This is much more\\nlikely to bring you fulﬁllment in the long run.\\nIf you want to learn how to use your time both e\\x00ectively\\nand meaningfully in greater depth, read Book 8 in my\\nMastery Series, Master Your Time.\\nTrick #4—you’re missing out\\nChecking emails or news every thirty minutes gives you the\\nillusion of having some control over your environment. You\\ndon’t want to miss an urgent email or the latest breaking\\nnews, right?\\nBut do you always need to reply to emails right away? Do you\\nreally have to check the latest news regularly?\\nThis way of thinking results from the fear of missing out.\\nAnd this fear reﬂects a scarcity mindset, which is based on\\nthe idea that there might be a limited number of\\nopportunities available to you. As such, you should seize\\neach opportunity while you still can, shouldn’t you? But\\nopportunities are everywhere. There will always be more in\\nthe future. Thus, if you “miss” a piece of news, were unable\\nto join a particular event, or failed to watch your favorite\\nYouTuber’s last live video, it’s okay. Sure, I wouldn’t\\nrecommend you miss the birth of your children or the\\nwedding of your brother or sister, but for most events, it\\ndoesn’t matter.Personally, I seldom read the news and never answer my\\nphone unless I know who the caller is. And I almost never\\nworry about missing a speciﬁc event because I know there\\nwill always be more events to enjoy in the future.\\nWhat about you? Do you experience the fear of missing out?\\nAs you go through your day, take note of whenever you fall\\ninto these traps. Awareness will help as you start to work on\\nlowering your level of stimulation and becoming more\\nfocused on your goals.\\nAction step\\nUsing your action guide, rate yourself for each of the\\nfollowing tricks on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 meaning you don’t\\nfall for that trap, 10 meaning it described your situation\\nperfectly).\\nTrick #1—My mind convinces me going back to work is easy.\\nTrick #2—My mind tells me I can do it later.\\nTrick #3—My mind makes me believe that excitement is\\nsimilar to fulﬁllment.\\nTrick #4—My mind tells me opportunities are limited.PART III\\nTHE BENEFITS OF A DETOX\\nThe di\\x00erent types of dopamine detox and their respective\\nbeneﬁts\\nSo far, we’ve seen that one of the major problems preventing\\nyou doing the hard work is overstimulation. Therefore, the\\nsolution to tackling your major tasks is to reduce your level\\nof stimulation. This is what the dopamine detox is for.\\nWhat is dopamine detox?\\nDopamine detox describes the following process:\\nThe reduction of stimulation to prevent overstimulation and\\nput you in the proper state of mind to tackle major tasks.\\nQuick disclaimer:\\nScientiﬁcally speaking, the term “dopamine detox” is\\nincorrect as it seems to imply that you’re releasing too much\\ndopamine into your system. In truth, when you’re\\noverstimulated, you simply need more external stimuli for\\nthe same amount of dopamine to be released.A dopamine detox helps reduce stimulation, thereby\\nallowing you to revert to a more natural state. When you\\nneed less stimulation, seemingly challenging, boring or\\ntedious tasks will become more appealing—and easier to\\ntackle.\\nNow, let’s have a look at the di\\x00erent types of dopamine\\ndetox available. In this book, I will introduce you to three\\ndistinct types as below:\\nThe 48-hour complete dopamine detox.\\nThe 24-hour dopamine detox.\\nThe partial dopamine detox.\\nLet’s describe each process in greater depth and discuss how\\nthey work.\\nThe 48-hour complete dopamine detox\\nThis is the most demanding type of dopamine detox. The\\npremise is simple:\\nYou must eliminate most or all sources of external\\nstimulation for a total of 48 hours. Doing so will help you\\nreduce your overall level of stimulation and revert to your\\nnatural state. You will feel much calmer and ﬁnd it easier to\\nfocus on any speciﬁc important task.\\nBy “eliminating all external sources of stimulation”, I mean\\nyou need to remove the following things from your life for\\n48 hours:\\nDrug/alcohol consumption,\\nExercising,\\nInternet,\\nMovies,Music (except perhaps for relaxation music),\\nPhone,\\nSocial media,\\nSugar/processed foods, and\\nVideo games.\\nEach of the above activities stimulates you, some more than\\nothers. Now, you might wonder:\\nIf I eliminate these distractions, what should I be doing\\ninstead?\\nHere are some suggestions:\\nGoing for a contemplative walk,\\nJournaling,\\nMeditating/relaxing,\\nPracticing awareness exercises,\\nReading (except stimulating read perhaps), and\\nStretching exercises.\\nAs you can see, the 48-hour dopamine detox is intensive and\\nmight appear rather drastic. But it could be even more\\nextreme. One of my friends, Nils, attended a Vipassana\\nretreat, which is a 10-day meditation retreat. During the ten\\ndays, the participants are required to:\\nMaintain complete silence (and have no gesture or\\neye contact with anyone),\\nHave no physical contact,\\nTake no physical exercise,\\nStop smoking, drinking, or taking any other drugs,\\nGive up their phone and internet, and have no outside\\ncontacts,Avoid music, reading, and writing, and\\nAvoid ﬁlming or taking pictures.\\nBy comparison, the 48-hour dopamine detox sounds easy,\\nright?\\nNils relates his experience in detail in his article, My 10-Day\\nVipassana Experience (Silent Meditation Retreat).\\nThe 24-hour dopamine detox\\nThis type is similar to the 48-hour dopamine detox but is, by\\ndeﬁnition, shorter. As such, although it will be easier, it will\\nalso be a little less e\\x00ective. Note that it can take several\\ndays for your stimulation to revert to its natural level.\\nThe partial dopamine detox\\nThis type is less demanding, but it can be highly e\\x00ective\\nwhen maintained over a longer period of time. It entails\\nremoving your biggest source of stimulation. Usually, one\\nspeciﬁc activity acts as your greatest distraction. For\\ninstance, for me, it is YouTube.\\nWhat about you? What’s your biggest source of stimulation?\\nIn the next section, we’ll see how to identify it and what to\\ndo to eliminate it e\\x00ectively.\\nAction step\\nUsing your action guide, write down which type of dopamine\\ndetox you want to implement right now.PART IV\\nA THREE-STEP METHOD FOR A\\nSUCCESSFUL DETOX\\nIn this section, we’ll go over a simple three-step method to\\nhelp you perform a successful dopamine detox.\\nStep #1. Identify your biggest distractions\\nThe ﬁrst step to implementing an e\\x00ective dopamine detox\\nis to identify your biggest temptations and distractions. To\\ndo so, take a pen and a sheet of paper (or use your action\\nguide), and create two columns, “Cans” and “Can’ts”.\\nIn the ﬁrst column write down all the activities you will\\nallow yourself to engage in. For instance, it might be going\\nfor a walk, journaling, working on a project, or reading\\nbooks. In the second column, write down all the things you\\nmust avoid doing during your dopamine detox. For instance,\\nit might be watching YouTube, checking your emails, or\\nusing social media.\\nTo help you do this, ask yourself the following questions:If I stopped doing only one thing, which one would\\nincrease my focus and boost my productivity the most\\ndramatically?\\nWhat other activity do I need to avoid in order to help\\nme increase my focus most signiﬁcantly?\\nKeep asking yourself this question, until you’re happy with\\nyour answers.\\nOnce you have completed your list, put it on your desk or\\nsomewhere you will see it. It will act as a good reminder of\\nthe activities you must avoid.\\nStep #2. Add friction\\nGenerally speaking, the harder something is to access, the\\nless likely you are to do it and vice-versa. This is why you\\nmust redesign your environment to make undesirable\\nbehaviors more di\\x00cult to engage in while making more\\ndesirable behaviors easier to conduct.\\nLook at the habits or activities you want to eliminate and ask\\nyourself how you could add friction—the more friction, the\\nbetter. For instance:\\nIf your phone is your biggest distraction, remove all\\nnotiﬁcations or put it on airplane mode. Or, even\\nbetter, switch it o\\x00 and put it in a separate room.\\nIf Facebook is your biggest distraction, remove as\\nmany notiﬁcations as you can and/or use applications\\nsuch as Newsfeed Eradicator (a Google Chrome\\nextension).\\nIf you spend hours watching YouTube videos, install\\nDF Tube on your Google Chrome navigator, or ﬁnd a\\nsimilar app for your internet browser. This willremove all the suggestions and notiﬁcations. Then,\\nonly watch videos that serve a speciﬁc purpose.\\nAdding friction might sound overly simple, but it works. This\\nis because, as humans, we’re fundamentally lazy. We hate\\nwasting energy unless we are forced to. If you need to go to\\nanother room to grab your phone (friction #1) and also need\\nto turn it on (friction #2), you are less likely to do it for a\\nwhile. After I put my internet modem in my storage room, to\\nget it back I needed to:\\nLeave my apartment (friction #1),\\nTake the elevator to descend four ﬂoors (friction #2),\\nOpen four doors (friction #3, #4, #5, and #6) to reach\\nmy modem, and\\nRepeat the actions in reverse (friction #7 to #12).\\nThis is a great deal of friction. Since I spent energy to take\\nmy modem to the storage room in the ﬁrst place, my mind\\nresisted getting it back right away. This would be a great\\nwaste of energy, which my mind doesn’t like.\\nThe bottom line is, the more di\\x00cult you make it to engage\\nin unwanted behaviors, the better.\\nConversely, make your desired behaviors as frictionless as\\npossible. For instance, to facilitate writing in the morning, I\\navoid checking my phone or my emails and leave my word\\nprocessor open. Then, I often put on relaxing music and use\\na timer (I like to do 45-minute work sessions). By doing so,\\nI’ve removed friction and obtained the buy-in from my\\nmind. It wouldn’t make sense if I suddenly stopped the\\nmusic, paused the timer, and moved on to another activity.\\nMy mind would see it as a waste of energy. Of course, I maystill procrastinate, but removing friction and creating a\\nsimple routine reduces the chances of me doing so.\\nYour turn now. How could you add friction to eliminate\\nunwanted behaviors?\\nLook at your list of “Can’ts”. Next to each of them,\\nwrite down speciﬁc things you could do to a d d\\nfriction.\\nThen, look at your list of “Cans” and write down\\nthings you could do to e li m i n a t e friction.\\nRemember, your mind is lazy. Use this to your advantage.\\nStep #3 Start ﬁrst thing in the morning\\nThe third and ﬁnal step is simply to get started. I\\nrecommend you start ﬁrst thing in the morning before\\nbecoming overly stimulated. I’ve noticed that if I check my\\nphone or access the internet upon waking up, I will probably\\nbecome distracted.\\nI also recommend you create a morning routine to help you\\nstart your day on a positive note and with a strong focus.\\nOver the long term, a simple morning routine can make a\\nmassive di\\x00erence in your life.\\nWhat about you? What’s the ﬁrst thing you do when you\\nwake up? Does this help you remain calm and focused, or\\ndoes it lead you to feel overstimulated and result in\\nprocrastination?\\nTo establish your morning routine, write down two or three\\nsimple things you could do each morning. You’ll use these\\nactivities to kickstart your dopamine detox—and, hopefully,\\nyou will stick to the routine over the long term. Rememberthat the routine should deepen your focus rather than\\nstimulate you. For instance, you could:\\nMeditate,\\nStretch,\\nListen to some relaxation music,\\nWrite down your goals for the day,\\nWrite down three things you’re grateful for, or\\nRepeat positive a\\x00rmations.\\nAction step\\nUsing your action guide, create a simple daily routine to\\nfollow during your dopamine detox (and beyond).\\nTo sum up, in order to implement a successful dopamine\\ndetox you should:\\n1. Identify your biggest temptations and/or distractions\\nand write them down on the sheet of paper. Then,\\nmake sure you put the sheet in a prominent position.\\n2. Make unwanted behaviors harder to engage in by\\na d d i n g friction.\\n3. Make desired behaves easier to engage in by r e d u c i n g\\nfriction.\\n4. Implement a simple morning routine to calm your\\nmind and start your day with a low level of\\nstimulation.\\nNow, decide whether you want to do a 48-hour, a 24-hour or\\na partial detox. Then, identify the main sources of\\nstimulation you’ll eliminate as you go through your detox.For the 48-hour and 24-hour detox, try removing most, if\\nnot all, sources of stimulation. Stay away from the internet.\\nRefrain from gambling. Avoid watching TV. Stop playing\\nvideo games. Eat light meals free of sugar and processed\\nfood. Turn o\\x00 your phone, and so on. For the partial detox,\\nstrive to remove your biggest source(s) of distraction.\\nTips to make the most of your dopamine detox\\nBelow are a few tips that will help you maximize the beneﬁts\\nyou’ll obtain from your dopamine detox.\\nTake notes\\nDuring your dopamine detox, I encourage you to take notes.\\nIf you feel restless, write it down. If you experience an urge\\nto check your phone or to watch videos, write this down too.\\nThat way, you’ll be able to identify your biggest sources of\\nstimulation and learn more about the way your brain works.\\nReﬂect on your life\\nWhen we’re constantly busy and overstimulated, we\\nsometimes fail to take a step back. We can’t see the forest for\\nthe trees. Use your dopamine detox as a way to zoom out. To\\ndo so:\\nReﬂect on your goals. What goals are you pursuing?\\nAre they the right ones for you? Are you making\\nprogress toward them each day? And if you keep\\ndoing what you’re doing, will you reach them?\\nAssess how you’re using your time. Are you being\\ntruly productive each day? Do you spend time on\\nthings that matter? Which activities or projects do\\nyou really need to focus on? Which ones do you want\\nto stop doing?Self-reﬂect. Are you where you want to be in life?\\nWhat inner work could you do to improve yourself?\\nSolve your problems\\nIf you have any problems or worries, write them down\\nalongside potential solutions. Just putting your thoughts on\\npaper can help you declutter your mind and gain clarity. This\\nis because it’s di\\x00cult to address thoughts that stay in your\\nmind. You tend to ruminate on them. On the other hand,\\nwriting them down makes them more concrete. It helps\\nclarify your thinking. By giving words to your thoughts (or\\nworries), you can address them more easily.\\nI encourage you to take a pen and a sheet of paper and\\nanswer the questions above. In the absence of highly\\nstimulating activities, you’ll be calmer and more relaxed,\\nand this, in turn, will allow you to develop greater insight.\\nMore generally speaking, dedicating time to thinking each\\nweek can make a major di\\x00erence in your life. It can prevent\\nyou making big mistakes and save you a great deal of time\\nand energy. Therefore, refuse to let busyness be an excuse to\\navoid reﬂecting on your life.\\nIdentify your fears\\nFinally, our never-ending search for stimulation is often an\\nattempt to hide our fears. Being busy enables us to avoid\\nhaving to face unpleasant feelings and scary truths about\\nourselves. Thus, if you notice certain disempowering\\nthoughts or underlying fears, write them down too.PART V\\nDOING THE WORK (AND\\nOVERCOMING PROCRASTINATION)\\nOne of the main goals of a dopamine detox is to lower your\\nlevel of stimulation to help you feel more motivated to work\\non key tasks. In this section, we’ll see what you can do to\\nmaintain the momentum and overcome your tendency to\\nprocrastinate.\\nPlan your day\\nBeing intentional with your day is an e\\x00ective way to boost\\nyour productivity. When you take time each day to decide\\nwhat you want to accomplish, you limit the risk of\\ndistraction. Consequently, the more intentional you are, the\\nbetter.\\nPlanning your day is important for the following reasons:\\nIt gives you an opportunity to clarify which tasks are\\nimportant and which ones aren’t.\\nIt reduces the odds of your mind distracting you\\nduring the day. Because you know exactly what youhave to do, you can move from one task to the next\\nsmoothly and without distractions.\\nYou will feel less stressed and more in control.\\nInstead of reacting to your environment and letting it\\ndistract you, you will move toward your goals\\nproactively.\\nHow to plan your day\\nYou don’t need fancy tools to plan your day. Instead, you can\\nuse a secret technique forgotten by many—pen and paper.\\nSimply write down a few key tasks you must achieve today.\\nThree to ﬁve tasks might be ideal. Place them in order of\\nimportance and start working on your ﬁrst task. Once you\\ncomplete it, proceed to the next. Repeat the process until you\\nhave completed all the tasks on your list.\\nNow, here are a few things to consider:\\nMake sure these are key tasks that move the needle forward.\\nTo help you identify your major tasks, you can ask yourself\\nthe following question:\\nIf I could complete only one task today, which one would\\nhave the greatest impact?\\nIf you’re still unsure, ask yourself this question:\\nIf I could complete only one task today before taking a\\nmonth o\\x00, what would that task be?\\nYou’ll notice that your most important tasks are often the\\nones you want to do the least. Perhaps, it’s because they are\\nchallenging. Perhaps, you don’t know where to start. Or,\\nperhaps, they’re boring. But your dopamine detox will help\\nmake these tasks easier to tackle.Note that you can use the same method to set weekly,\\nquarterly, monthly and yearly goals. I also recommend you\\ncreate a long-term vision. It could be a ﬁve- or ten-year\\nplan. Of course, it won’t be perfect, but simply having an\\nidea of the direction to follow will make a huge di\\x00erence.\\nTo set short-term goals, reverse-engineer what you must do\\nto reach your long-term goals. For instance, if I want to\\nwrite a book in the next ninety days, one goal could be to\\ncreate an outline. Another could be to complete the ﬁrst\\ndraft. And to hit that target, I could establish a speciﬁc daily\\nword count.\\nAction step\\nUsing your action guide or a separate sheet of paper, write\\ndown your daily and weekly goals.\\nSchedule one major task to work on each morning\\nWhile there are thousands of books on productivity, only a\\nfew principles matter. I believe the most important one is to\\nidentify your key task and tackle it ﬁrst thing in the morning\\n—and do this consistently.\\nEven though you might have a never-ending to-do list, there\\nare always a few major tasks that, when completed, will\\nskyrocket your productivity. Unless you can complete them,\\nnothing else will really matter.\\nThe key to productivity can be summarized in three words:\\n1. Focus,\\n2. Consistency, and3. Impact.\\n1. Focus is your ability to maintain your concentration and\\navoid distraction or procrastination while working on your\\ntasks.\\n2. Consistency means developing the habit of working on\\nyour key tasks every day, week after week, month after\\nmonth, and year after year.\\n3. Impact means identifying your key tasks (the ones that\\nhave the greatest impact on your long-term success) and\\nworking on them as often as possible.\\nProductivity can then be deﬁned as having consistent focus\\non your most impactful tasks.\\nNow, let’s see what you can do speciﬁcally to stay focused on\\nyour most important task each day.\\nDevelop laser-sharp focus\\nYour ability to develop laser-sharp focus is one of the most\\nimportant things you can do to improve your productivity.\\nBy focusing on your key tasks consistently for just forty-ﬁve\\nminutes daily, you can make more progress than you can\\nwith almost anything else you could be doing instead.\\nIn this section, we’ll discuss speciﬁc things you can do to\\nbuild your focus and complete your key tasks each day.\\n1. Be at the same place, at the same time every day\\nAs we mentioned before, a simple daily routine will help you\\ncondition your mind, help you feel more in control, and\\nlower your stimulation. As a result, starting work will\\nbecome easier.One thing that will strengthen your routine is to be at the\\nsame place at the same time each day. The famous writer,\\nStephen King, sits at his desk every day at the same time and\\nwrites. He doesn’t wait for inspiration to come. Instead, he\\nstarts, knowing that inspiration will come as he immerses\\nhimself in his work. Do the same thing. Choose a time and\\nplace where you’ll be tackling your major tasks each day.\\nThen, practice doing it one day at a time, and you will\\ngradually build your consistency and focus.\\nRemember, productivity is nothing more than focusing on\\nyour most impactful tasks and doing so consistently.\\nWhat about you? Where will you be when you dedicate time\\nto do your most important work, and when will you start?\\n2. Choose a trigger\\nAs you create your routine, choose a speciﬁc trigger. It could\\nbe making tea and sitting at your desk. Or it could be\\ncompleting your meditation session. Try to select a trigger\\nthat will help calm your mind. When you are relaxed, you’ll\\nﬁnd it easier to begin work.\\nWhat about you? What activity could kickstart your daily\\nroutine?\\n3. Get started\\nOnce you have created your routine and identiﬁed your\\ntrigger, get started. If you can start work on your tasks for a\\nfew minutes, you’ll likely build enough momentum to keep\\ngoing. You might even experience ﬂow. (Named by the\\npsychologist Mihaly Csíkszentmihályi, the “ﬂow” is a\\nmental state in which you’re so fully immersed in an activity\\nthat you become hyper-focused, while experiencing a sense\\nof underlying enjoyment). Again, the more relaxed you are,the easier it will be to focus. So, just get started and don’t\\nworry about completing your task perfectly. It’s okay if you\\ndon’t feel motivated or creative, taking action will generate\\nmotivation and stimulate your creativity.\\n4. Eliminate distractions\\nWhen you work, remove all distractions. Turn o\\x00\\nnotiﬁcations on your phone, disconnect from social media\\nand stay away from the internet unless it’s needed for\\nspeciﬁc research. In addition, ask others not to disturb you.\\nThe more you practice working distraction-free, the\\nstronger your focus will become.\\n5. Work without interruptions\\nNow that you have eliminated distractions, work\\ncontinuously, without interruptions. I recommend forty-ﬁve\\nminutes of intense work as a maximum. If you want to do\\nseveral sessions, take a ﬁve- to ten-minute break between\\neach work block.\\nFollowing the ﬁve steps above will strengthen your focus and\\nboost your productivity. And, as you procrastinate less, you’ll\\nfeel better, which will positively impact other areas of your\\nlife.\\nTo learn more on how to develop laser-sharp focus, refer to\\nbook three in this series, Powerful Focus.\\nAction step\\nUsing your action guide, follow the steps below to develop\\nlaser-sharp focus:1. Decide what time you will focus on your key tasks.\\nThen, make sure you’re at the same place at the same\\ntime each day.\\n2. Choose a speciﬁc trigger to signal the start of your\\nmorning routine.\\n3. Just get started. When you work on your tasks for a\\nfew minutes, you’ll be more likely to enter the ﬂow\\nand keep working longer.\\n4. Eliminate any distractions (phone notiﬁcations,\\ninternet, et cetera), and\\n5. Finally, work without interruption. Aim to complete\\nforty-ﬁve minutes of uninterrupted work.\\nBeware of open systems\\nThe activities with the biggest potential for distractions are\\nusually part of an open system.\\nWhat is an open system?\\nAn open system is simply an application or situation that\\nprovides you with a continuous and never-ending supply of\\nexternal stimuli. Some examples are emails, Facebook,\\nYouTube, and, more generally, the internet as a whole.\\nWhenever you enter an open system, you risk becoming\\noverstimulated. For instance, if the ﬁrst thing you do in the\\nmorning is to check Facebook, you might ﬁnd yourself:\\nScrolling down your newsfeed for no reason,\\nWatching one video after the next, or\\nMessaging a friend and entering a long conversation.\\nOnce you ﬁnally close Facebook, you might ﬁnd yourself so\\nstimulated, you’ll struggle to begin work.This is why you must guard against entering an open system\\n—and understand the risk you take if you do so. With open\\nsystems, there is no end to reach, no point at which you can\\never be ﬁnished, and an almost inﬁnite number of ways to\\nbecome distracted. As a result, you can end up wasting hours\\nof your time each day. In short, open systems create\\ndistractions. Instead, you should strive to design closed\\nsystems.\\nWhat are closed systems?\\nThese are systems that o\\x00er little or no room for\\ndistractions. As a result, they force you to work on your task\\n—and only on it. Some examples are Excel spreadsheets,\\nWord documents, or PowerPoint presentations.\\nThese days, I strive to open the ﬁle for the book I’m\\ncurrently writing, before doing anything else on my\\ncomputer. I also avoid checking my phone. In other words, I\\nstart my day with a closed system, and I encourage you to do\\nthe same.\\nWhen you begin your working day with a closed system, you\\ncan avoid becoming overstimulated, which will make it\\neasier for you to work on challenging tasks. And as you do so\\neach day, you’ll feel better and will want to work on even\\nmore tasks. So, perhaps one of the biggest secrets to\\novercoming procrastination and becoming more productive\\nis to start your day with a closed system. This way, you can\\navoid countless distractions.\\nRemember, what you do ﬁrst thing in the morning matters\\nfar more than you think. Just one tiny decision can have a\\ndramatic e\\x00ect on your day’s productivity.Action step\\nUsing your action guide, write down a few examples of open\\nsystems that lead to you becoming distracted. Then, write\\ndown one closed system you could implement to help you\\nincrease your productivity.PART VI\\nAVOIDING “DOPAMINE RELAPSE”\\nCongratulations! You’ve just completed a dopamine detox\\nand now, I bet you feel much more relaxed and far more in\\ncontrol of your day. But what next?\\nIf you’re not careful, you’ll inevitably relapse. Old habits die\\nhard. That’s why, in this section, we’ll describe a few speciﬁc\\nthings you can do to avoid reverting back to your never-\\nending stimulation loop.\\nLet’s get started.\\n1. Be aware when you start relapsing\\nSelf-awareness is the key to making lasting change. The ﬁrst\\nstep to avoid or limit relapses is to notice whenever you ﬁnd\\nyourself becoming overstimulated. When you struggle to\\nwork on an important task, stop for a moment. Then,\\nrecommit to your daily routine.\\nIn truth, you will probably relapse after a few days, weeks or\\nmonths. And this is completely normal. I ﬁnd myself going\\nfrom periods when I’m hyper-focused to periods when I feelrestless and so overstimulated that I struggle to complete\\nany work.\\n2. Understand the battle between you and your mind\\nWhen it happens to you, the key is to accept it and avoid\\nfeeling guilty. Beating yourself up won’t help you build a\\nsuccessful daily routine. It will only make things worse.\\nTherefore, don’t dwell on it. Don’t feel guilty or ashamed of\\nyourself. Simply restart your routine and do it one day at a\\ntime.\\n3. Understand that the world is against you\\nIn today’s world, maintaining focus has become incredibly\\ndi\\x00cult. That’s because everybody is vying for our attention.\\nAnd I’m not just talking about our family members, friends,\\nor colleagues. I’m also talking about marketers, YouTubers,\\nor bloggers. Nowadays more than ever, the ability to attract\\npeople’s attention is one of the biggest sources of income for\\nmany companies. In short, your focus is worth a lot of\\nmoney, which is why YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram do\\neverything they can to keep you glued to your screen.\\nHowever, your focus is also worth a lot of money to you.\\nWhen you reclaim your focus and use it to achieve your\\nbiggest goals, you can transform your life radically. You can\\nmake more money by channeling your focus into great work,\\nand you can increase your well-being by redirecting it\\ntoward more meaningful activities (i.e., spending time with\\nyour family and friends or engaging in your favorite\\nhobbies).\\nHere’s my point. The world is working against you. There\\nwill always be someone trying to grab your attention. As\\nsuch, you have two choices. You can protect your focus bybuilding habits and systems, or you can remain unprepared\\nand let anyone distract you from the important things you\\nshould be doing with your time.\\nWhich option will you choose?\\n4. Prepare a contingency plan\\nAn e\\x00ective way to avoid relapsing is to create a contingency\\nplan. To do so, think of all the ways you are likely to lose\\nyour focus and revert to your previous behaviors, and guard\\nagainst them by creating a contingency plan.\\nSo, what things could make you relapse?\\nFor instance, if I check my phone ﬁrst thing in the morning,\\nI’ll probably end up jumping from one stimulation to the\\nnext. I’ll check Facebook, then perhaps reply to a message.\\nThis message may remind me of something else I need to do\\nor it might give me ideas. Suddenly, my mind will become\\nagitated and provide me with a plethora of good reasons not\\nto write this morning.\\nTo create your contingency plan:\\nConsider all the activities with the highest potential\\nfor distraction. To identify them, revisit the list of\\n“Can’ts” you created earlier.\\nEnvision the worst-case scenarios. What could lead\\nyou to lose focus and stop doing your morning\\nroutine? Using your action guide, write down all the\\nworst-case scenarios you can think of.\\nPrepare yourself mentally. Visualize yourself going\\nthrough these scenarios. How will you react? Now,\\nhow would you like to react? See yourself dealing with\\nthese scenarios the best way possible.5. Put a sustainable system in place\\nThe key to lowering your levels of stimulation is to\\nimplement a simple and sustainable system. This system\\ndoesn’t necessarily entail a complete shutdown from\\ndistractions, but it does require putting in place habits that\\nwill help you stay focused.\\nConsequently, as we’ve seen before, make sure you have a\\nsimple daily routine you can stick to consistently.\\n6. Cultivate the here-and-now neurotransmitters\\nTo prevent overstimulation, cultivate the “here-and-now”\\nneurotransmitters, which include endorphin, oxytocin, or\\nserotonin. These neurotransmitters are the opposite of\\ndopamine neurotransmitters in that they make you feel\\ncalmer and more present. To activate these\\nneurotransmitters, incorporate activities that ground you in\\nthe present such as:\\nMeditation. By meditating even for just a few\\nminutes, you can practice being more “present in the\\nmoment”. To do so, close your eyes and focus your\\nattention on your breathing. You can also place your\\nattention on one of your ﬁve senses. Then, switch to\\nanother sense, and another, and so on. There are no\\nincorrect ways to meditate. Look for meditation books\\nfor beginners, search for meditation videos online, or\\nsimply experiment and see what works best for you.\\nStretching. When you stretch, you automatically relax\\nyour body and slow your breathing, which enables\\nyou to feel calmer and more present.\\nMindfulness. This means being aware of what’s\\ngoing inside you and around you. There are many\\nways to practice mindfulness. For example, you caneat slowly while noticing each ﬂavor or texture. Or\\nyou can place your attention on your body and\\nobserve all the sensations you’re experiencing from\\nhead to toe. You could also practice completing\\nhousehold or work-related chores, while trying to be\\nas present as possible.\\nContemplative walking. How present are you when\\nyou go for a walk? Do you hear the birds singing? Do\\nyou feel the wind blowing on your face? Do you notice\\nthe shape of clouds? Often, people become stuck in\\ntheir head thinking of their next task or worrying\\nabout problems in their life. Don’t be like them. Next\\ntime you go for a walk, observe things around you as\\nif you were seeing them for the ﬁrst time. Focus on\\neach of your senses. See things you’ve never seen\\nbefore. Hear sounds you’ve never heard before. Smell\\naromas you’ve never smelled before. Experience\\nbodily sensations you’ve never noticed before. Be\\npresent!\\nDeep social interactions. Interacting with other\\nhuman beings activates neurotransmitters such as\\noxytocin, which is sometimes called the “love\\nhormone”. The more present you are, the more you’ll\\nbe able to connect and experience a pleasant sense of\\nbonding. Therefore, make sure you spend enough\\ntime around the people you care about.\\nBoredom. Practicing doing nothing is a good way to\\nlower your level of stimulation. Our mind constantly\\nwants to do things. For a moment, be okay with doing\\nnothing. Sit down and observe things, eat in silence or\\nwalk with no speciﬁc intent or destination in mind.\\nBy incorporating some of the above activities, you’ll be\\ncalmer and more present during your day. As a result, youwill reduce the risk of becoming overstimulated.\\nWhat about you? What activities could you implement in\\nyour daily routine?\\nAction step\\nUsing your action guide, write down at least one activity you\\ncould engage in every day in order to stay calm and focused.\\nCommit to a 30-Day Challenge.\\nTo beneﬁt from your dopamine detox, I encourage you to\\nimplement a simple daily routine to adhere to for the next\\nthirty days. See it as a 30-Day Challenge. This will help you\\navoid reverting to your old habits as soon as you ﬁnish your\\ndopamine detox.\\nAlternatively, you can read the other books in the series as\\nyou continue your journey toward higher levels of focus and\\nproductivity. Each subsequent book in the series will help\\nyou build a critical skill in just seven days.\\n• In Book 2, Immediate Action, you’ll discover how to\\novercome procrastination.\\n• In Book 3, Powerful Focus, you’ll learn how to gain clarity\\nand develop laser-sharp focus.\\n• In Book 4, Strategic Mindset, you’ll reﬁne your critical\\nthinking skills and develop a crystal-clear strategy that will\\nhelp you skyrocket your productivity.CONCLUSION\\nYou can choose to control your focus, or you can let someone\\nelse take it away from you. When you learn to avoid highly\\nstimulating activities that destroy your ability to remain\\ncalm and focused, you’ll ﬁnd yourself capable of tackling\\nyour major tasks with more ease than ever before. Going\\nthrough a dopamine detox will help you lower your level of\\nstimulation and ensure you work on your major tasks.\\nRemember that excitement and fulﬁllment aren’t the same\\nthings. As you learn to eliminate external stimulations and\\nimmerse yourself in your work, hobbies, or relationships,\\nyou’ll experience a deeper sense of fulﬁllment and will feel\\nmuch better. You will also end up becoming far more\\nproductive and accomplishing many of your goals and\\ndreams.\\nSo, stop letting your environment hijack your brain and\\nregain control of it instead. This is the key to a healthy and\\nproductive life.OTHER BOOKS BY THE AUTHORS:\\nCrush Your Limits: Break Free from Limitations and Achieve Your True Potential\\nGoal Setting: The Ultimate Guide to Achieving Life-Changing Goals\\nHabits That Stick: The Ultimate Guide to Building Habits That Stick Once and For\\nAll\\nMaster Your Beliefs: A Practical Guide to Stop Doubting Yourself and Build\\nUnshakeable Conﬁdence\\nMaster Your Destiny: A Practical Guide to Rewrite Your Story and Become the\\nPerson You Want to Be\\nMaster Your Emotions: A Practical Guide to Overcome Negativity and Better\\nManage Your Feelings\\nMaster Your Focus: A Practical Guide to Stop Chasing the Next Thing and Focus\\non What Matters Until It's Done\\nMaster Your Motivation: A Practical Guide to Unstick Yourself, Build Momentum\\nand Sustain Long-Term Motivation\\nMaster Your Success: Timeless Principles to Develop Inner Conﬁdence and Create\\nAuthentic Success\\nMaster Your Thinking: A Practical Guide to Align Yourself with Reality and\\nAchieve Tangible Results in the Real World\\nProductivity Beast: An Unconventional Guide to Getting Things Done\\nThe Greatness Manifesto: Overcome Your Fear and Go After What You Really\\nWant\\nThe One Goal: Master the Art of Goal Setting, Win Your Inner Battles, and\\nAchieve Exceptional Results\\nThe Passion Manifesto: Escape the Rat Race, Uncover Your Passion and Design a\\nCareer and Life You Love\\nThe Thriving Introvert: Embrace the Gift of Introversion and Live the Life You\\nWere Meant to Live\\nThe Ultimate Goal Setting Planner: Become an Unstoppable Goal Achiever in 90\\nDays or Less\\nUpgrade Yourself: Simple Strategies to Transform Your Mindset, Improve Your\\nHabits and Change Your Life\\nSuccess is Inevitable: 17 Laws to Unlock Your Hidden Potential, Skyrocket Your\\nConﬁdence and Get What You Want From LifeWake Up Call: How To Take Control Of Your Morning And Transform Your LifeFurther boost your productivity\\nThis book is part of a four-book series on productivity.
